def compute_ball_tf(N='', n='', sigma='', c='', p=''):

    # compute_ball_tf - compute the voting kernel of a ball tensor.
    #
    #   T = compute_ball_tf(N,n,sigma,c,p);
    #
    #   'N' is the total size of the image (supposed to lie in [0,1]x[0,1]).
    #
    #       The equation for the decay of the field is
    #           DF(s,k) = exp(-(s^2+c*k^2)/sigma^2)
    #       where 's' is the length of the circle that joins
    #       the two points, and 'k' is its curvature.
    #
    #   Optional:
    #   'sigma' control the scale of the voting field.
    #   'c' control the ratio between distance and curvature.
    #       The higher 'c' is, the narrower the field will be.
    #   'n' is the size of the kernel (should be odd).
    #
    #   'p' is the number of orientation samples needed to compute the field.
    #       (the higher the slower the computation).
    #
